# How this quiz app works:
In this quiz app we can add multiple questions and 4 answer choices for each questions. When you select any one answer, the answer button's background color will become green if it is correct answer and the background color will become red if it is wrong answer.
After selecting one answer you can not change the answer, you can only go for next question.
